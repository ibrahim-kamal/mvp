# Code Task: Most Valuable Player
---
## General Rules

 We need to create a tournament where several players compete in several sports. Right now, the sports played are `basketball` and `handball` matches. We plan to add more sports in the future.

You have been contacted to create a program to calculate the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the given match results.

You will receive a set of files, each one containing the stats of one match. Each file will start with a row indicating the sport it refers to.

Each player is assigned a unique nickname. Each file represent a single match. The MVP is the player with the most rating points.

A player will receive `10 additional rating points` if their team won the match. Every match must have a winner team.

The program responsible of generating the files has a bug, that can be reflected in wrong files format. If one file is wrong, the whole set of files is considered to be wrong and the MVP won't be calculated.

## Basketball

Each row will represent one player stats, with the format:
```
player name;nickname;number;team name;position;scored points;rebounds;assists
```
This table details the rating points each player in a basketball match receives depending on his position:
E.g. a player playing as center with `10 scored points`, `5 rebounds` and `no assists` will be granted `25 rating points` `(10*2 + 5*1 + 0*3)`.
The winner team is the one with more scored points.

|             | Scored point | Rebound | Assist |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Guard (G)   | 2            | 3       | 1      |
| Forward (F) | 2            | 2       | 2      |
| Center (C)  | 2            | 1       | 3      |


#### Basketball Example

```csv
  BASKETBALL
  player 1;nick1;4;Team A;G;10;2;7
  player 2;nick2;8;Team A;F;0;10;0
  player 3;nick3;15;Team A;C;15;10;4
  player 4;nick4;16;Team B;G;20;0;0
  player 5;nick5;23;Team B;F;4;7;7
  player 6;nick6;42;Team B;C;8;10;0
```

## Handball

Each row will represent one player stats, with the format:
```
player name;nickname;number;team name;position;goals made;goals received
```
This table details the rating points each player in a handball match receives depending on his position:

|                  | Initial rating points | Goal made | Goal recieved |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Goalkeeper (G)   | 50                    | 5         | -2            |
| Field player (F) | 20                    | 1         | -1            |

E.g. a player playing as `goalkeeper` with `1 goals made` and `10 received` will be granted `35 rating points` `(50 + 1*5 - 10*2)`.
The winner team is the one with more scored points.



#### Handball Example:

```csv
  HANDBALL
  player 1;nick1;4;Team A;G;0;20
  player 2;nick2;8;Team A;F;15;20
  player 3;nick3;15;Team A;F;10;20
  player 4;nick4;16;Team B;G;1;25
  player 5;nick5;23;Team B;F;12;25
  player 6;nick6;42;Team B;F;8;25
```

## What we look at

You have `4 days` to complete the task, you should use `PHP laravel framework`. It is not mandatory to read input from file system. It is acceptable to read from stdin, forms or any other source.

- We are interested in how you structure your code.
- The code should be open for extension closed for modification `we should be able to add new sport without changing the core calculator`.
- We are interested in seeing how efficient the algorithm you implement is.
- We are interested in seeing how you unit test your code.

## Nice to Have:

- Dockerize your solution.
- Struct database schema.
